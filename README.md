# MMS: The Minkowski Metric Simulation
Ontology of Special Relativity Theory

in progress ...  
   
   
Now, simulation models are widely used in logistics, healthcare, technology, and much other area.  
However, in scientific research, preference is given to numerical modeling. This is due to the fact that there is no clear understanding of how to build scientific simulation models.  
If we will use simulation in nanotechnology or molecular biology then we must be able to simulate both relativity and quantum effects.  
Here, we discuss modeling of effects of the special relativity theory.
We introduce MMS, a python package providing discret spacetime model for special reletivety theory.  
This all numerical results is result of measurement on object structurs.
