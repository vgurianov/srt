Implementation of the Robust Random Cut Forest Algorithm for anomaly detection by Guha et al. (2016).
About
The Robust Random Cut Forest (RRCF) algorithm is an ensemble method for detecting outliers in streaming data. RRCF offers a number of features that many competing anomaly detection algorithms lack. Specifically, RRCF:
