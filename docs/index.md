# MMS: The Minkovski Metric Simulation
MMS is a software package that can be used to simulate of the Minkovski metric. 
It uses UML2 SP language to non-numeric modeling.  
About non-numeric modelsand UML2 SP
mms is the Minkovski Metric Simulation  
Special Reletivity Software  

## 1. Simulation model  
We use Unified Process and it is reflect in structure of site. Unified Process include 6th  workflow: Requirements, Analysis, Design and Realisation.  

1.1.Use-Case Model  
Use case model is function requirements to software.

1.2. Analysis Model  
Analysis model is simulation model. It is ontology of mechanical motion. This semantic net define follow concept:  
		1.1. Synchronization (Minkovsky metric)  
		1.2. Motion  
		1.3. Interaction  
		1.4. Measurements  
	We show class and communication diagram, and model in pseudo-code C++  

1.3. Design Model  
Design model in Python

## 2. Package API  
Overview is component diagram

2.1. experimentX  
	It is execution modules  

2.2. mms.mms module  
It is base modules of simulation model  

2.3. mms.resacherInstruments module  
It is classes of measurements and process of data  

2.4. mms.pintResult module  
It is output data to print  

2.5. mms.graths module  
It is output data to graphics  


## 3. Experiments  
3.1. Getting Started  
Install and execute.  
3.2. The time dilation (experiment1 module)  
3.3. The Lorentz Contraction  
3.4. Velosety versus momentum (experiment2 module) and Energy versus momentum (experiment2 module)
