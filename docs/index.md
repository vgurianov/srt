# MMS: The Minkowski Metric Simulation
MMS is a software package that can be used to simulate the Minkowski metric.  
The simulation model is described on [UML2 SP](https://vgurianov.github.io/uml-sp/) and implemented in Pothon.    


## 1. Simulation model  
We use the Unified Process and it is reflected in the structure of the site. Unified Process include 4th  workflows: Requirements, Analysis, Design, and Realisation.  

1.1.Use-Case Model  
The Use-Case model is function requirements to software.

1.2. Analysis Model  
The analysis model is a simulation model. It is an ontology of mechanical motion. This semantic net define follow concept:  
- Synchronization    
- Motion and Interaction  
- Measurements  
  
We present class diagrams and communication diagrams, and pseudocode C++.  

1.3. Design Model  
Design model developed for Python.

## 2. Package API  
2.1. Overview is a component diagram.

2.2. mms.mms module  
It is base modules of the simulation model  

2.3. mms.resacher_instruments module  
It is classes of measurements and process of data  

2.4. mms.pint_result module  
It is output data to print  

2.5. mms.graths module  
It is output data in plot forms


## 3. Experiments  
3.1. Getting Started  
Install and execute.  
3.2. The time dilation (experiment1.py module)  
3.3. Velocity as function momentum and energy as function momentum (experiment2.py module)  
3.4. The inertial reference frame is a simulate uniform translatory motion of a reference frame (experiment3.py module)
