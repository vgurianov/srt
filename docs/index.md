# MMS: The Minkowski Metric Simulation
MMS is a software package that can be used to simulate of the Minkowski metric.  
It uses UML2 SP language to non-numeric modeling.  


## 1. Simulation model  
We use Unified Process and it is reflect in structure of site. Unified Process include 4th  workflow: Requirements, Analysis, Design and Realisation.  

1.1.Use-Case Model  
Use case model is function requirements to software.

1.2. Analysis Model  
Analysis model is simulation model. It is ontology of mechanical motion. This semantic net define follow concept:  
		1.1. Synchronization (Minkowsky metric)  
		1.2. Motion  
		1.3. Interaction  
		1.4. Measurements  
We present class and communication diagrams, and model in pseudo-code C++  

1.3. Design Model  
Design model in Python

## 2. Package API  
2.1. Overview is component diagram.

2.2. mms.mms module  
It is base modules of simulation model  

2.3. mms.resacher_instruments module  
It is classes of measurements and process of data  

2.4. mms.pint_result module  
It is output data to print  

2.5. mms.graths module  
It is output data in plot forms


## 3. Experiments  
3.1. Getting Started  
Install and execute.  
3.2. The time dilation (experiment1 module)  
3.3. The Lorentz Contraction  
3.4. Velosety versus momentum (experiment2 module) and Energy versus momentum (experiment2 module)
