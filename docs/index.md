# MMS: The Minkowski Metric Simulation
MMS is a software package that can be used to simulate the Minkowski metric.  
We usage UML2 SP language to non-numeric modeling.  


## 1. Simulation model  
We use the Unified Process and it is reflected in the structure of the site. Unified Process include 4th  workflows: Requirements, Analysis, Design, and Realisation.  

1.1.Use-Case Model  
The Use-Case model is function requirements to software.

1.2. Analysis Model  
The analysis model is a simulation model. It is an ontology of mechanical motion. This semantic net define follow concept:  
		1.1. Synchronization (Minkowsky metric)  
		1.2. Motion and Interaction  
		1.4. Measurements  
We present class and communication diagrams, and model in pseudo-code C++  

1.3. Design Model  
Design model as Python

## 2. Package API  
2.1. Overview is a component diagram.

2.2. mms.mms module  
It is base modules of the simulation model  

2.3. mms.resacher_instruments module  
It is classes of measurements and process of data  

2.4. mms.pint_result module  
It is output data to print  

2.5. mms.graths module  
It is output data in plot forms


## 3. Experiments  
3.1. Getting Started  
Install and execute.  
3.2. The time dilation (experiment1 module)  
3.3. Velocity as function momentum and energy as function momentum (experiment2 module)  
3.4. The inertial reference frame is a simulate uniform translatory motion of a reference frame (experiment3 module)
